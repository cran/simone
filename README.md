# SIMoNe: Statistical Inference for Modular Networks

[![Travis build
status](https://travis-ci.org/jchiquet/simone.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jchiquet/simone)
[![AppVeyor build
status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/jchiquet/simone?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/jchiquet/simone)

> The goals of SIMoNe is to implement methods for the inference of
> co-expression networks based on partial correlation coefficients from
> either steady-state or time-course transcriptomic data. Note that with
> both type of data this package can deal with samples collected in
> different experimental conditions and therefore not identically
> distributed. In this particular case, multiple but related networks
> are inferred on one simone run.
